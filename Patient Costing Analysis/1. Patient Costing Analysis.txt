Patient Costing Analysis – Requirements

Points of Interest based on discussions with the user(s) …
* Patient counts
* Revenue received
* Costs
* Practioner profitability

After discussions we established that a single dashboard should be designed and built to 
provide insight...

Dashboard Scope: Patient Costing Analysis 

Sheet inventory : CEO summary page
GEO Analytics
Behaviour
Delivery Medium : Interaction at the healthcare facility via the desktop

The broad metrics that the user requires are...
* Patient count
* Averages for length of stay (LOS), Age
* Highlight Revenue, Cost and Profit, Previous Year & Month Cost for comparison 
* Year based profitability
* Practitioner Profitability
* Patient activity (e.g. Country of origin, Admission type, LOS etc.)
* Gender ratio
* Average length of stay (LOS) by specialty and cost 
* Average length of stay (LOS) by age group and profitability
* Time since discharge
* GEO Analytics patient origins showing Counts, Revenue, Cost, LOS, 
profitability, average age using Maps
Other considerations for dashboard interaction are the use of appropriate dimensions...
* Admission Date drill down capability e.g. Year >>> Month >> Date
* Age Group Drill Down e.g. Age Group >>> Age
* Filter selections by Admission year, Specialty, Gender.
